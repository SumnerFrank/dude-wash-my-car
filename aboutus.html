    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a group of UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, that while discussing some hobbies, realized we enjoy washing
      our cars and keeping them clean. However, we soon discovered that we hated washing our cars and right after,
      having our hard work and love washed away by the rain, even more! So, we decided to come up with a solution to
      this issue.
      And the end goal, was this site, where now you can not only locate a nearby car wash, but also know the weather as
      well, before washing your car.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center">Our goal is to assist you in locating the best option when it comes to washing your car and prevent damages.</h2>

        bummer that is. That beautiful shine you just worked so hard to get out of your car wash, quickly gone, with
        some rain. Unexpected or just the bad luck all car owners seem to have?</p>
