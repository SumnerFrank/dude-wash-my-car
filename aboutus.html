    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a group of UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp students, that while discussing some hobbies, realized we enjoy washing
      our cars and keeping them clean. However, we soon discovered that we hated washing our cars and right after,
      having our hard work and love washed away by the rain, even more! So, we decided to come up with a solution to
      this issue.
      And the end goal, was this site, where now you can not only locate a nearby car wash, but also know the weather as
      well, before washing your car.</p>
